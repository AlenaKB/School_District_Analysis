# School_District_Analysis
The goals of this challenge are:

Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
Replace the incorrect values with NaN.
Explain how your PyCitySchools analysis changes after you handle the incorrect data.  

I used the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook to replace incorrect data in columns using logical operations with conditionals; retrieved data from DataFrames; merged, filtered, sliced, and sorted DataFrames; and applied the groupby() function to a DataFrame. Using these methods, I created a new analysis with the incorrect data removed.
