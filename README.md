## Project Description 
In this project I analyzed data from 4 different school disctricts. Some the score averages for ninth graders from one high school were incorrect. I removed the math and reading scores for that high school, but without removing those ninth-grade students from the analysis. After that, I analyzed how the district and school summary are affected. As well as how removing the ninth-grade scores affects the math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
